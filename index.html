 The World of One-Punch-Man
 <p>Most at first glance don't give One-punch-man's setting much thought. 
     It's just the background of a guy that one shots everybody right? 
     Actually, it's so much more. Here are some facts on how the world 
     of One-punch-man operates.

        At the pinnacle of the hero ranking system is the 
             S-class. There are currently only 17 individuals 
            with this ranking. Members of this rank must be 
            extremely powerful and most can can individually 
            defeat a demon ranked threat.

    <div class="image-2">
        <img src="Images/class-A.png" alt="a-class">
        Following the S-class is the A-class. Currently there 
            are 38 members and all are very capable fighters.
            These members are a good bit weaker then the S-class, but 
            have built a strong reputation and are well known and considered 
            very reliable. Heroes in this class are capable of defeating
            threat level tigers on their own. 
    </div>
    <div class="image-3">
        <img src="Images/b- class.png" alt="b-class">
        3rd in the classification is the B-class. Currently there are 101 members.
            Typically B-class fighters are a step down considerably from
             the prior 2. These are still capable fighters but usually form
              groups as they are not able to defeat any strong enemies or 
              monsters alone. The top of the B-class are strong individual fighters,
              however, and are also well known.

    <div class="image-4">
        <img src="Images/c-class.jpg" alt="c-class">
        C-class is the weakest of the classes and by far the largest. Currently
            there are 390 members but it is a volitle number. Members in this class 
            typically are of average human strength and mmust perform weekly heroic 
            acts to fufill their quotas to remain apart of the hero registry.
            These heroes are usually accomplishing feats against typical acts of
            violence or in groups against wolf level threats.

    <p>"I know no one expects much from me. And I know better than 
            anyone how useless a C-class hero is. I know I'm too weak 
            even for B-class! I know more than anyone else I'll never 
            beat you. But I must fight you anyway!
